- [ ] Verify service worker is registered
- [ ] Check status is "activated and running"
- [ ] View cached resources in Cache Storage
- [ ] Verify static assets are cached

### 7. Production Build Test
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Service worker is generated in `/public/`
- [ ] Production server starts
- [ ] All features work in production mode

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Visual Features
- ✨ Modern, gradient background

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Service Worker Not Found
**Solution**: Run `npm run build` to generate the service worker

### Issue: IndexedDB Not Working
**Solution**: Check you're not in incognito/private mode

### Issue: PWA Not Installable
**Solution**: 
- Use HTTPS or localhost
- Ensure manifest.json is accessible
- Check icons exist (even if empty)

### Issue: Offline Mode Not Working
**Solution**: 
- Build the app first (`npm run build`)
- Service worker only works in production or after build

## 📝 Notes

- Development mode may not show full PWA features
- For complete PWA testing, build and run in production mode
- Icons are placeholder files - replace with actual images for production
- The demo page showcases all integrated features

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Replace placeholder icons with real app icons
2. Test on mobile devices
3. Test installation on different browsers
4. Add more shadcn components as needed
5. Implement additional features (sync, notifications, etc.)
